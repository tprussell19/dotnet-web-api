## Setup and Use

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A browser like Chrome or Firefox
- [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
- An application to consume the api like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or VS Code extension [Thunder Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/tprussell19/ProjectName.Solution`
2. Navigate to the `ProjectName.Solution/` directory on your computer
3. Open with your preferred text editor to view the code base
4. Create a database using SQL via Entity:

- Navigate to `ProjectName.Solution/ProjectName` in your command line
- Create a file named `appsettings.json` and paste the following code:
  ```
  {
    "Logging": {
      "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Warning",
        "System": "Information",
        "Microsoft": "Information"
      }
    },
    "AllowedHosts": "*",
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=project_name;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"
    }
  }
  ```
  Note: Be sure to change `[YOUR-PASSWORD-GOES-HERE]` to your actual MySQL password.
- Once the migration has been added, run the command `dotnet ef database update` to setup your database. (If this command throws and error, you might have to run the command `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef` first.)

5. To run the app:
   - Navigate to `ProjectName.Solution/ProjectName` in your command line
   - Run the command `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies that are listed in the .csproj
   - Run the commmand `dotnet build` to build the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries
   - Finally, run the command `dotnet run` to run the project!
   - Note: `dotnet run` also restores and builds the project, so you can use this single command to start the app and launch
   - Once the application is running, you can use Postman or Thunder Client to access the API.
